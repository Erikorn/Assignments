You wake in a cold and dark room. A small, barred hole in the ceiling reveals
just enough moonlight for you to make out three things:
A door, a hole in the wall, and a bucket.

What do you do?



Inspect the Door   



  It appears to be a large and solid wooden door,
  with a smaller wicket door in the center.
  There is also an iron keyhole on the side.") 

Knock on the Door
  
  Almost as soon as your fist connects with the door,
  an angry looking dwarf opens the wicket door and punches you in the groin.
  The tiny door slams shut as you collapse to the floor.
  A chorus of gruff laughter erupting from the other side.

Knock on the Door (2nd Time)

   Yeah no, I don't think that's a good idea.")

Open the Door (without key)

  You try the door.  It seems to be locked and will not budge.
  You hear a lot of smirks and chuckles from the other side. 

Open the Door (without key 2nd time)

  You already tried that idiot.
  It's obviously still locked.")

Open the Door (with key)

  You insert the foul-smelling key into the iron lock.
  With some effort it turns with a loud click.
  The door swings opens easily, exposing a line of grinning Dwarves.
  Their palms raised in the air, waiting to reward you 
  with high fives in celebration of your glorious victory.

  WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER

Leave the Door Alone

  You step back, leaving the door alone for now.



Inspect the Hole 




  You step forward, taking a closer look at the hole.
  Your gaze transfixed by the ominous darkness inside.
  It seems to be just about wide enough to reach through.

Peek through the Frightening Hole

  As you crouch down to peer through the hole,
  a very green and VERY solid fist punches you in the face. 

Peek through the Frightening Hole(2nd Time)

  Against your better judgement,
  you crouch back down to look through the hole again.
  Once again you find yourself on your back, this time with a broken nose.
  I don't know why you thought that was a good idea. 

Reach into the Terrifying Hole

  The voice of reason in your head screams for you to stop.
  You tentatively reach your hand into the hole.
  A green hand suddenly locks around your wrist with a terrifying strength.
  Pulling with an insane amount of force, you hear the sickening
  sound of flesh tearing as your arm is ripped out of it's socket.
  You fall to the ground, life force gushing from where your shoulder used to be.
  As your vision fades, a sadistic cackling can be heard from the other side.
  For some reason, you feel like this was not a very smart thing to do.

Leave the Scary-Ass Hole Alone

  You manage to tear your gaze away and leave the Scary-Ass Hole Alone,
  Relief washes over you, and you feel as if you avoided something terrible. 


      
Inspect the Bucket    



  A fetid stench invades your senses as you approach.
  It appears to be a simple metal bucket...
  A very smelly, simple, metal bucket.

Kick the Stinky Bucket!

  This bucket smells foul enough as it is!
  Are you sure you want its contents spread across the room?

    KICK IT!!!!!

      With a satisfying punt, you send the bucket soaring across the room.
      It's vile filth explodes throughout the room as it crashes against the wall.
      You hear short footsteps angrily race toward your cell.
      The door bursting open, a stout and angry Dwarf unsheathes a short sword and runs you through.
      You Collapse to the floor, desperately clinging to your stomach
      in vain as your innards spill out.  As you perish, your final, dying thought is an ironic one:
      You just figuratively and literally kicked the bucket.

    On second thought, better not.

Search the Smelly Bucket.

  You try to suppress a gag, holding your breath as you reach into the Bucket.
  Trying not to think of what you're sifting through, you hand clasps onto something cool and hard.
  Pulling your hand out, you find yourself holding a very dirty, and smelly iron key.

Leave the Foul Smelling-Bucket Alone.

  You leave the smelly bucket alone for now.
