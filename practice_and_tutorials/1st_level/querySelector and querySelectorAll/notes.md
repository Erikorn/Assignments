If you've ever used jQuery before, you know they use a really useful method of selecting elements from the page - using CSS selectors! You've already learned about CSS selectors, so it can be really nice using them to select elements in JavaScript too.

You're welcome to use whichever selectors you prefer, so long as you remember which ones select single elements and which select groups of elements
