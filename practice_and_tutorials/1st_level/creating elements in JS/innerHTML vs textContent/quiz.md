## Tasks:

1. Search Google to learn a little more about the difference between the `.append()` method and the `.appendChild()` method

2. What do you see as pros/cons of using `.createElement()` and `append()` vs. `.innerHTML`?

3. What happens if I create an element using `.createElement()` but don't use `.append()`?

4. How might you use a for loop in conjunction with the DOM methods for create elements?
